Regarding the website

Open the ‘Website source codes’ folder

This front-end is developed using Reactjs framework.
First install the nodejs, (a javascript run time)

In the nodejs terminal run ‘npm install’

Then go to client folder and again run ‘npm install’

Go back to ‘Website source codes’ and run ‘npm run dev’
 
It will start up both server and client concurrently

(This is just an incomplete website only client login is working!)
